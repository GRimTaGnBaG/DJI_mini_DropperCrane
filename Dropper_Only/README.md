This is for those who only want the dropper feature.

Get your ESP-32s ready. Get your RYLR998 ready.

First program your RYLR998 first. Before wiring!!

Flash the basestationat to one.
Flash the at-drone to the other.
Look at the wiring diagram in the main thread,the DIFF for dropper only, dont wire in the 360 servo.
